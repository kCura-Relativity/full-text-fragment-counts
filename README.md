# full-text-fragment-counts
Open Source Community: This script reports on the number of fragments in the fulltext catalog for each database on a server.  If fulltext catalogs are fragmented, keyword search performance can be affected. Ideally the fragment count should stay below 10 for a given database.  If fragmentation is high, a maintenance script can be run to eliminate fragmentation.
